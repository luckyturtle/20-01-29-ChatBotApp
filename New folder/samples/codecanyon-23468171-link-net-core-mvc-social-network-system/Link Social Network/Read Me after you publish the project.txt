If you had some of these problems after publish your project:
- error 405 methods not allowed asp net core put delete requests.
- fails on login or new registration.

Then

Copy and paste the below code into  "web.config" 
into  <system.webServer> </system.webServer> element.
 <modules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests="false">
        <remove name="WebDAVModule" />
  </modules>

Or 

1. Open  "Files can help" folder. You will find "web.config" file.
2. Copy and paste it into you published folder project.
